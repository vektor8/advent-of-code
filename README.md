# Advent Of CodeðŸŽ„

## 2023 - Rust

This was my very first time taking part in the event and I'm glad that I finally joined as the problems proved to be engaging and fun. At the same time I used this opportunity to learn about Rust and use it for the first time. I found that coding in it enhanced the already fun experience provided by AOC.

For most days I was able to think through and implement my original solution, but around day 21 I started to find the the part 2 of the problems a little above my level and cheated by surfing online for explanations. I found hyper-neutrino's ([Link to his Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@hyper-neutrino)) video explanations extremely well thought-out and easy to wrap your head around. Thanks to them I was able to understand the solutions and implement them.

### Lessons

- Always look at the actual input and not only the test one as it may have been crafted with the intention to help make the problem more manageable
- The Rust hype is huge and rightfully so, coding in a language with this type of performance and power never felt so good
